# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project exists to provide neutral, factual data visualization showing the current number of signatures on a specific Change.org petition as a percentage of Port Moody's total population. The goal is to present this information in a transparent, unbiased manner for informational purposes only.

## Problems It Solves

- Provides transparent access to petition signature data relative to the city's population
- Offers a neutral, factual representation of community engagement with the petition
- Creates a reliable source of information with clear methodology and data sources

## How It Should Work

1. The application fetches the current signature count from the Change.org petition
2. It calculates the percentage of signatures relative to Port Moody's population (33,535)
3. The data is displayed through clear visualizations (progress bar, chart)
4. A timestamp shows when the data was last updated
5. The application provides factual context without encouraging any particular action
6. The entire codebase is publicly available on GitHub for transparency

## Data Sources

- Petition URL: https://www.change.org/p/stop-conflict-of-interest-on-port-moody-city-council
- Port Moody Population: 33,535 (used as denominator for percentage calculation)
