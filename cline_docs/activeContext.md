## Next Steps

1. Test the application locally to ensure it works as expected
2. Verify that the data fetching from Change.org works correctly
3. Create a GitHub repository for the project
4. Set up Vercel for deployment
5. Deploy the application
6. Monitor the application for any issues

## Current Focus

The immediate focus is on testing the application locally to ensure that the data fetching from Change.org works correctly and that the visualization displays properly. Once testing is complete, the next step is to set up the GitHub repository and deploy the application to Vercel.
