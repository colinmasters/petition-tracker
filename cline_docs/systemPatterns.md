# System Patterns

## How the System is Built

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern Next.js architecture with the following key components:

1. **Frontend Layer**

   - React components for UI rendering
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Client-side data fetching with SWR or React Query

2. **API Layer**

   - Next.js API routes for server-side operations
   - Serverless functions on Vercel
   - Data caching mechanisms

3. **Data Layer**
   - External data source (Change.org petition)
   - Optional local storage or database for caching

### Data Flow

1. User visits the application
2. Application checks for cached data
3. If cache is valid, display cached data
4. If cache is expired or missing, fetch new data from Change.org
5. Process and calculate percentage based on Port Moody population
6. Update cache with new data
7. Display visualization to user

## Key Technical Decisions

### Next.js Framework

- Provides both frontend and backend capabilities
- Enables serverless API routes
- Supports TypeScript natively
- Offers excellent performance optimization

### TypeScript

- Ensures type safety across the application
- Improves developer experience with better tooling
- Reduces potential runtime errors

### Tailwind CSS

- Provides utility-first approach for rapid UI development
- Ensures consistent styling
- Optimizes for production with minimal CSS

### Data Fetching Strategy

- Server-side fetching to handle CORS and rate limiting
- Caching to minimize requests to Change.org
- Error handling for failed requests

### Deployment

- GitHub for version control and transparency
- Vercel for continuous deployment
- Environment variables for configuration

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture

- Atomic design principles for UI components
- Clear separation between presentation and logic
- Reusable components for consistency

### Data Fetching Pattern

- Custom hooks for data fetching
- SWR or React Query for client-side data management
- Server-side fetching for initial data

### Error Handling Pattern

- Graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- Clear error messages for users
- Fallback UI components

### Caching Strategy

- Time-based cache invalidation
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Background refresh of data
